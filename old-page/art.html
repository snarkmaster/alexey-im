		<h2>Drawing, painting, photography</h2>
		<p>
		I've experimented with digital image manipulation for quite a few years, 
		producing some pictures; last year, I got a digital camera, and have since
		taken over 10000 shots -- many good ones, but cleaning and organizing them 
		is an undertaking for a long vacation. Who knows when that will come, or whether
		I will be able to keep up. Handling my huge amounts of media has concerned
		me for a while, see <a href="projects.html">Projects</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
		This semester I'm taking an introductory painting course, which puts my 
		has so far been very helpful in honing what I've been doing for a while,
		as well as opening new avenues. I had no idea of how amazingly good oil
		paints are until now.
		</p>
		<h2>Music</h2>
		<p>
		I have an eclectic collection which includes orchestral/chamber music from 
		the 18th century to the present, Russian and English rock, electronica of many 
		kinds, songs of many Russian bards, and a variety of other things. Next 
		semester my live "currently listening to" list should be working again. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Recently, I've began learning guitar in spare moments. So far my aspirations include 
		learning to play Город (версию Аквариума); Звезду по имени Солнце, Кукушку (Цоя);
		Прикосновение к земле, Милую мою (Визбора). I'm making some progress. 
		</p>
		
		<h2>Literature</h2>
		<p>
		Recently, I've been reading fiction mostly in Russian -- my class reading and
		written communications provide plenty of English. Some of my favorite authors (most
		non-English authors have translations):
		</p>
		<div>
		Mihail Bulgakov,
		Vladimir Nabokov,
		Ray Bradbury, 
		Ursula Le Guin, 
		Many 19-th century Russian classics (Pushkin, Tolstoj, Dostoevskij, Chehov, Gogol', ...),
		Stanislaw Lem,
		Ryunoske Akutagawa
		</div>
		<p>
		My "to read" list has long outgrown any reasonable size, so reading now is a 
		spur-of-the-moment activity. Recent books that I liked a lot  were: a collection 
		of Akutagawa's short stories, Lem's "Hay fever" ("Насморк", hope my translation is right),
		and "A manuscript found in the bathtub" ("Рукопись, найденная в ванной").
		</p>
		<p>
		I like writing; however, expository essays required by typical humanities classes aren't much
		of an outlet. I'm hoping to be admitted into a creative writing class next semester.
